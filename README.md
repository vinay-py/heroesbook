Hint: You do not have to follow the sequence of the A.C. as long as you accomplish them all at the end.

Personas
GC publishing expects the following user personas:

Name	Role
Visitor	A regular visitor who comes to view the heroes.
Note: roles are provided by the requester and trusted automatically by the server

Acceptance Criteria
Visitors

As a visitor, I can view all the heroes.

When I view all the heros
Then I can see names of all heros
As a visitor, I can see information about any individual hero so that I can see their stats.

Rule: Heroes have an image, real name, hero name, height, weight, special power, intelligence, strength, power, speed, agility, description, and story.

Given I have the name of a hero
When I retreive the hero
Then I can view all the details for that hero

Given I have an incorrect hero name
When I retreive details for that hero
Then I receive a message that it doesn't exist
